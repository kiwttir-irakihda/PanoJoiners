# PanoJoiners

## Motivation

When we deal in panorama images in cameras we want only the horizontal span of the canvas.
In this process we clip away the edges and retain the useful ones.

The motivation of this project is to tackle two problems
1. Generating a panoramic image from videos
2. Attempt at Panography

- Panography is helpful to give us more information of the surroundings.
- I also want to use Panography on multiview images.

The approach as many flaws, but its an experiment.
